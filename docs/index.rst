Welcome to syncfit's documentation!
===================================

The :code:`syncfit` module allows users to model synchrotron emission spectral energy distributions to
extract properties about the system. This uses the SED models from the following sources:
* `mq_model.py` : Margalit & Quataert (2024) at https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002ApJ...568..820G/abstract
* all other models : Granot & Sari (2002) at https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002ApJ...568..820G/abstract
If you use this code, you should be citing them!
